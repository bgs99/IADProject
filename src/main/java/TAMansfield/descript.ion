SEPO_BOT DESCRIPTION

A simple Telegram bot for course project.

Since bots can't start interaction with users, functionality is limited to "request-response" operations. 
The rest is expected to be covered with JavaMail and other means.
Bot will fully duplicate "request-response" operations with the system.
